The class will exlopre how we can use AI to assist in these tasks.

### details
* Understand how to connect an empirical question to data

Try get a report with a single prompt

### AI 2

* Have an interative process where key exhibits are created
* Pick a regression (with at least one control variable) and get AI interpret a coefficient
