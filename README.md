**Version**: v.0.4. 2025-04-04 

## TARGET AUDIENCE
This is a couse aimed at 3rd (2nd?) year BA and (A students) in any program with required background. 

### Background

You need a background in **Data Analysis / Econometrics**, a good introductory course is enough. I, *of course*, suggest Chapters 1-12 and 19 of [Data Analysis for Business, Economics and Policy (Cambridge UP, 2021)](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/getting-started). Full slideshows, data and code are open source. But consider buying the book. 
In particular, the course builds on [Chapters 1-6 and 7-10, and 19 of Data Analysis ](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/chapter-details/) but other Introductory Econometrics + basics of data science knowledge is ok.

Students are expected to have some basic **coding knowledge** in Python or R (Stata also fine mostly). 


## COURSE DESCRIPTION
### Content

This course will equip students, who are already versed in core data analysis methods, with experience to harness AI technologies to improve productivity (*yes this is classic LLM sentence*). But, yeah, the idea is to help students who studied data analysis / econometrics / quant methods and want to think about **how to include AI in their analytics routine**, and spend time to share experiences. As AI becomes more and more powerful, it is also important to provide a platform to **dicuss human agency in data analysis**. 

The course focuses on using large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude.ai, Mistral's Le Chat, and Google's Gemini) to carry out tasks in data analysis. It includes topics like data extraction and wrangling, data exploration and descriptive statistics, and creating reports as well as turning text to data. The course material includes **weekly assignments**. 

### Relevance

AI is everywhere and has become essential, most analytical work will be using it.

2. LEARNING OUTCOMES
Key outcomes. By the end of the course, students will be able to

* Gain experience and confidence using genAI to carry out key tasks in data analysis.
* Build AI in coding practice including data wrangling, description and reporting and text analysis
* Have some idea of use cases when AI assistance is (1) greatly useful, (2) helpful, (3) currently problematic. 
* Have some idea of use cases when AI assistance is OK to use as is vs needs strong human supervision
* Have an understanding of resources to follow for updates. 

### Assignments

Assignments are available for all classes

**Important to note for assignments: **
* Use AI but do not submit something that was created by AI. AI is your assistant.
* One of the goals of the course is to practice this. 

## Week01: LLM Review

What are LLMs, how is the magic happening. A non-technical brief intro. How to work with LLMs? Plus ideas on applications. Includes suggested readings, podcasts, and vids to listen to.

## Week02: Data and code discovery and documentation with AI

Learn how to write a clear and professional code and data documentation. LLMs are great help once you know the basics.

## Week 03: Writing Reports

You have your data and task, and need to write a short report. We compare different options with LLM, from one-shot prompt to iteration.

## Week04: Data wrangling, joining tables

When asked about what I shall add to my textbook, David Card, the Nobel winning empirical economist told me that I shall spend time with joining tables. Here we go.

## Week05: Text as data 1 -- intro lecture

No course of mine can escape football (soccer). Here we look at post-game interviews to learn basics of text analysis and apply LLMs in what they are best - context dependent learning. Two class series. First is more intro to natural language processing.

## Week06: Text as data 2 -- practice

Second class, now we are in action. How does LLM compare to humans?

## Thanks

**Thanks:** Developed mostly by [me, Gábor Békés](https://bsky.app/profile/gaborbekes.bsky.social) Thanks a million to the two wonderful human RAs, [Ms Zsuzsa Vadle](https://bsky.app/profile/zsuzsannavadle.bsky.social) and [Mr Kenneth Colombe](https://bsky.app/profile/kcolombe24.bsky.social), both Phd students. Thanks to Claude.ai that did a great deal of help in creating the simulated dataset. ChatGPT and Claude.ai helped create the slideshows and educated *me* on NLP. 

Thanks for CEU's teaching grant that allowed me pay humans and AI.

## And now, this.

AI use is very costly in terms of energy. Yes, it is becoming cheaper. But humanity is also using *much* more of it.
