**Version**: v.0.4. 2025-04-04 

**Background**: [Békés-Kézdi: Data Analysis for Business, Economics, and Policy](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/getting-started)

## TARGET AUDIENCE
This is a couse aimed at 3rd (2nd?) year BA and (1st year) MA students. You need a background in Data Analysis / Econometrics, but not much. I teach it to mostly Economics and Quant Social Science students, but don't be afraid / excited --- not much economics. 

## COURSE DESCRIPTION
### Content

This course will equip students, who are already versed in core data analysis methods, with experience to harness AI technologies to improve productivity. We will focus on using large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude.ai, Mistral's Le Chat, and Google's Gemini) to carry out tasks in data analysis. The course will focus on data extraction and wrangling, data exploration and descriptive statistics, and creating reports. The course involves a great deal of hands-on practice with weekly case studies and assignments. 

Like every course I do, this is also a bit of Data Analysis class where ideas like data wrangling, documentation, regression interpretation will come back. 

### Relevance

AI is everywhere and has become essential, most analytical work will be using it.

### Expected background

* The course builds on [Chapters 1-6 and 7-10 of Data Analysis ](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/chapter-details/) but other Introductory Econometrics + basics of data science knowledge is ok.
* Students are expected to have coding knowledge in R, Python or Stata. Some knowledge of Python or R is an advantage. Students will benefit from having familiarity with VScode or Rstudio or similar IDE

2. LEARNING OUTCOMES
Key outcomes. By the end of the course, students will be able to

* Gain experience and confidence using genAI to carry out key tasks in data analysis.
* Build AI in coding practice including data wrangling, description and reporting
* Have a basic idea of use cases when AI assistance is (1) greatly useful, (2) helpful, (3) currently problematic
* Have an understanding of resources to follow for updates. 

### Assignments

Assignments are available for all classes

**Important to note for assignments: **
* Use AI but do not submit something that was created by AI. AI is your assistant.
* One of the goals of the course is to practice this. 

## Week01: LLM Review

What are LLMs, how is the magic happening. A non-technical brief intro. How to work with LLMs? Plus ideas on applications. Includes suggested readings, podcasts, and vids to listen to.

## Week02: Data and code discovery and documentation with AI

Learn how to write a clear and professional code and data documentation. LLMs are great help once you know the basics. 

Case study: World Values Survey. Data is at [WVS](/data/VWS)

## Week 03: Writing Reports

You have your data and task, and need to write a short report. We compare different options with LLM, from one-shot prompt to iteration.

## Week04: Data wrangling, joining tables

When asked about what I shall add to my textbook, David Card, the Nobel winning empirical economist told me that I shall spend time with joining tables. Here we go.

## Week05: Text as data 1 -- intro lecture

No course of mine can escape football (soccer). Here we look at post-game interviews to learn basics of text analysis and apply LLMs in what they are best - context dependent learning. Two class series. First is more intro to natural language processing.

## Week06: Text as data 2 -- practice

Second class, now we are in action. How does LLM compare to humans?

## Thanks

**Thanks:** Developed mostly by [me, Gábor Békés](https://bsky.app/profile/gaborbekes.bsky.social) Thanks a million to the two wonderful human RAs, [Ms Zsuzsa Vadle](https://bsky.app/profile/zsuzsannavadle.bsky.social) and [Mr Kenneth Colombe](https://bsky.app/profile/kcolombe24.bsky.social), both Phd students. Thanks to Claude.ai that did a great deal of help in creating the simulated dataset. ChatGPT and Claude.ai helped create the slideshows and educated *me* on NLP. 

Thanks for CEU's teaching grant that allowed me pay humans and AI.
