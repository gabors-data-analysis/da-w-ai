Background: [Békés-Kézdi: Data Analysis for Business, Economics, adn Policy](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/getting-started)

## TARGET AUDIENCE
This is a couse aimed at 3rd (2nd?) yera BA and (1st year) MA students. You need a background in Data Analysis / Econometrics, but not much. I teach it to mostly Economics and Quant Social Science students, but not much economics. 

## COURSE DESCRIPTION
### Content

This course will equip students, who are already versed in core data analysis methods, with experience to harness AI technologies to improve productivity. We will focus on using large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude.ai, Mistral's Le Chat, and Google's Gemini) to carry out tasks in data analysis. The course will focus on data extraction and wrangling, data exploration and descriptive statistics, and creating reports. The course involves a great deal of hands-on practice with weekly case studies and assignments. 

Like every course I do, this is also a bit of Data Analysis class where ideas like data wrangling, documentation, regression interpretation will come back. 

### Relevance

AI is everywhere and has become essential, most analytical work will be using it.

### Expected background

* The course builds on [Chapters 1-6 and 7-10 of Data Analysis ](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/chapter-details/) but other Introductory Econometrics + basics of data science knowledge is ok.
* Students are expected to have coding knowledge in R, Python or Stata. Some knowledge of Python or R is an advantage. Students will benefit from having familiarity with VScode or Rstudio or similar IDE

2. LEARNING OUTCOMES
Key outcomes. By the end of the course, students will be able to

* Gain experience and confidence using genAI to carry out key tasks in data analysis.
* Build AI in coding practice including data wrangling, description and reporting
* Have a basic idea of use cases when AI assistance is (1) greatly useful, (2) helpful, (3) currently problematic
* Have an understanding of resources to follow for updates.
