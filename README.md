# Data Analysis with AI course

## COURSE DESCRIPTION
### Content. 

This course will equip students, who are already versed in core data analysis methods, with experience to harness AI technologies to improve productivity. We will focus on using large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, and Google Gemini) to carry out tasks in data analysis. The course will focus on data extraction and wrangling, data exploration and descriptive statistics, and creating reports. The course involves a great deal of hands-on practice with weekly case studies and assignments. 

### Relevance. 

AI is everywhere and has become essential, most analytical work will be using it.

### Expected background. 
• The course builds on [Chapters 1-6 and 7-10 of Data Analysis ](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/chapter-details/) but other Introductory Econometrics + basics of data science knowledge is ok.
