### Task

In this assignment, you will continue exploring the data, and create a readme document. This is an **individual** assignment. 

* Review good practices for readme and data documentation
* First, consider the WVS Survey we used in class: [Codebook](/case-studies/VWS/data/codebook.pdf), [sample data](/case-studies/VWS/data/WVS_random_subset2000.csv). See the [World Values Survey case study](/case-studies/VWS/) for more info. Link it to your AI. (Can move to google drive.)
* Second, choose a research question using the VWS data. It can be broad or specific. Ask AI for ideas.
* What variables would you use to investigate the research question? Pick the most relevant ones (min 8, max 25)
* Review survey timing and discuss consequences
* Considering these variables **only** create a single README.md (in markdown). 


**The readme**

In the readme, include:

* key info on the dataset itself (you need to figure out what this key info is based on the lecture and examples)
* key variables description
* table with descriptive statistics for the 5 most important selected variables


### To submit

* README.md file. (lastname_firstname_dawai_week02_readme.md) (16p)
* What advice would you give to a fellow data analysis student on **using AI to create README documents**? (lastname_firstname_dawai_week02_advice.txt) (4p)
    * List 2–3 pieces of advice based on your own experience using AI for this specific task.
  
### AI use restrictions

* Do not use AI to help you generate the advice. We want to hear your personal examples and reflections, not AI-generated suggestions.
