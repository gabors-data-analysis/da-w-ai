title: "Assignment 4: Extend the Austrian Hotels Dataset"
subtitle: "Create new data and analyze it with Claude Code"
---

## Overview

In this assignment, you will use Claude Code to:

1. **Generate a new data table** that can be joined to the Austrian Hotels dataset
2. **Join your new table** with existing data
3. **Perform an analysis** that answers an interesting question
4. **Document your process** and reflect on using agentic AI

## Deliverables

Submit a **single PDF** containing:

1. Your data generation prompt and the resulting table description
2. Your analysis with results (tables, charts, or statistics)
3. The key code Claude Code generated (not all of it - just the important parts)
4. A brief reflection (see Part 4)

## Part 1: Design Your Data Table (25%)

Create a new CSV file that joins to the Austrian Hotels dataset. Your table should:

- Have a clear **join key** (hotel_id, city, city+month+year, etc.)
- Contain **realistic patterns** (not random numbers)
- Enable an **interesting analysis question**

### Ideas (pick one or create your own):

| Table | Columns | Join Key | Analysis Question |
|-------|---------|----------|-------------------|
| **Weather** | city, month, year, avg_temp, precipitation, snow_days | city + month + year | Does weather affect occupancy? |
| **Staff** | hotel_id, num_employees, avg_wage, languages_spoken | hotel_id | Do staffing levels correlate with reviews? |
| **Events** | event_id, city, event_name, month, year, expected_visitors | city + month + year | How much do events boost hotel prices? |
| **Sustainability** | hotel_id, energy_rating, has_solar, waste_recycling_pct | hotel_id | Do eco-friendly hotels charge more? |
| **Transportation** | city, airport_distance_km, train_station_distance, public_transport_score | city | Does accessibility affect tourism? |

### What to submit:

- The **prompt** you gave Claude Code to generate the data
- A **summary** of your generated table (columns, row count, sample rows)
- Explanation of the **realistic patterns** you built in

## Part 2: Join and Analyze (40%)

Use Claude Code to join your new table with the existing Austrian Hotels data and answer your analysis question.

### Requirements:

- Perform at least **one join** operation
- Include **descriptive statistics** (means, counts, distributions)
- Create at least **one visualization** (chart or graph)
- Answer your analysis question with evidence

### What to submit:

- Your main **analysis question**
- Key **results** (tables, charts)
- Your **interpretation** - what does the data tell us?

## Part 3: Show Your Work (20%)

Include the key pieces of code that Claude Code generated. You don't need to include everything - focus on:

- The data generation script (or key parts of it)
- The join and analysis code
- Any interesting debugging or iteration

**Format:** Use code blocks in your PDF. If code is long, include just the important functions.

## Part 4: Reflection (15%)

Write 150-300 words reflecting on:

1. **Process:** How did you iterate with Claude Code? What did you have to clarify or fix?

2. **Comparison:** How did this workflow compare to using chat-based AI (ChatGPT/Claude.ai)? What was easier? Harder?

3. **Trust:** Did you verify Claude Code's output? How? Did you find any mistakes?

4. **Future use:** When would you use Claude Code vs chat AI in your own work?

## Grading Rubric

| Component | Excellent (90-100%) | Good (70-89%) | Needs Work (<70%) |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Data Design** | Creative, realistic patterns, clear join logic | Reasonable table, some patterns | Random data, unclear joins |
| **Analysis** | Clear question, appropriate methods, insightful interpretation | Decent analysis, basic interpretation | Unclear question, minimal analysis |
| **Code Quality** | Well-organized, key parts shown | Somewhat organized | Messy or missing |
| **Reflection** | Thoughtful insights on process and tools | Basic reflection | Superficial or missing |

## Tips

- **Be specific in prompts:** "5-star hotels should have 20% higher staff-to-room ratios" is better than "make it realistic"
- **Verify the data:** Ask Claude Code to show summary statistics after generating
- **Iterate:** If the first version isn't right, refine your prompt
- **Check joins:** Always verify row counts before and after joining
- **Save your work:** Keep the Python scripts Claude Code generates

## Submission

- **Format:** PDF
- **Due:** Sunday 23:55 before Week 5
- **Submit via:** Moodle
