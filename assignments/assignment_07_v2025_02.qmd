title: "Assignment 7: Mini Data Project"
subtitle: "Your own analysis using Claude Code"
---

## Overview

This is a **free-form mini project**. You'll use Claude Code to explore a question that interests you, generating new data and combining it with the Austrian Hotels dataset.

Think of this as a small-scale version of what a data analyst does: identify a question, get the data you need, analyze it, and communicate findings.

## The Task

**Create a short data story** that answers an interesting question about hotels, tourism, or the hospitality industry.

You must:

1. **Generate at least one new data table** using Claude Code
2. **Join it** with the Austrian Hotels data
3. **Analyze** the combined data to answer your question
4. **Present** your findings in a clear, concise report

## Deliverable

Submit a **PDF report (2-4 pages)** with:

### 1. Your Question (half page)
- What question are you investigating?
- Why is it interesting or useful?
- What data do you need to answer it?

### 2. Data Creation (half page)
- What new table(s) did you create?
- What realistic patterns did you build in? Why?
- Show a brief sample of the data (5-10 rows)

### 3. Analysis & Findings (1-2 pages)
- How did you join the data?
- What analysis did you perform?
- Include at least one table or chart
- What did you find? What's your answer to the question?

### 4. Reflection (half page)
- What worked well with Claude Code?
- What was tricky or surprising?
- What would you do differently next time?

## Project Ideas

Choose one or create your own:

| Question | New Data Needed |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Do eco-friendly hotels charge premium prices?** | Sustainability ratings by hotel |
| **How does weather affect ski resort occupancy?** | Monthly weather by city |
| **Which booking channels are most profitable?** | Booking channels + commissions |
| **Do renovated hotels get better reviews?** | Renovation history by hotel |
| **How do events impact hotel prices?** | Event calendar by city |
| **Is there a staffing crisis in hospitality?** | Staff counts over time |
| **Do family hotels have different booking patterns?** | Guest demographics |
| **Your own idea** | Your own data |

## What We're Looking For

| Aspect | What Makes It Good |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Question** | Clear, specific, answerable with data |
| **Data Design** | Realistic patterns, sensible join keys, well thought out |
| **Analysis** | Appropriate methods, clear presentation, honest about limitations |
| **Communication** | Easy to follow, good visuals, insights highlighted |
| **Reflection** | Genuine observations about the process and tools |

## Grading

- **Question & Motivation:** 15%
- **Data Generation:** 25%
- **Analysis Quality:** 35%
- **Presentation & Communication:** 15%
- **Reflection:** 10%

## Tips

**On the question:**
- Narrow is better than broad. "Do 5-star hotels in Vienna rely less on Booking.com?" beats "How do hotels use booking channels?"
- Make sure your question can actually be answered with the data you're creating

**On data generation:**
- Be specific in your prompts. "Ski resort cities should have 30% higher snow days in winter" is better than "make it realistic"
- Ask Claude Code to show summary statistics so you can verify
- It's OK to iterate - refine until it looks right

**On analysis:**
- Simple is fine. A clear bar chart beats a confusing regression
- Check your join results (row counts before and after)
- If findings are surprising, dig deeper - is it real or a data issue?

**On the report:**
- Include enough detail that someone could understand and reproduce your work
- Don't dump all your code - show key snippets only
- Use clear labels on charts and tables

## What NOT to Do

- Don't generate random data with no patterns - the point is realistic simulation
- Don't submit without checking that your joins worked correctly
- Don't overcomplicate - this is a mini project, not a thesis
- Don't forget to actually answer your question!

## Submission

- **Format:** PDF, 2-4 pages
- **Due:** Sunday 23:55 before Week 8
- **Submit via:** Moodle
