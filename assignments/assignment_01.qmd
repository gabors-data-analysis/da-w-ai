title: "Reproduce an FT graph"
---

Look at [this graph](/week01/assets/ft-liberation-day-usd-yield-2025-04-11.jpg) from Financial Times. Your task is to recreate this figure using real-world data. 

Use AI as your assistant to find real-world data that matches or closely resembles the one used in the FT graph, and recreate the same chart using that data.

**Success Criteria:**

- **Data accuracy:** Real Treasury yield and tariff announcement data
- **Design fidelity:** Similar visual style, annotations, and layout
- **Code quality:** Reproducible workflow with clear documentation


**what to submit and grading**

* Graph: A PDF version of your recreated graph, name it: "lastname_firstname_dawai_week01_ftfigure.pdf" (10p)
* Data: A CSV file with the data used to create the graph, with the name ("lastname_firstname_dawai_week01_ftdata.csv") (4p)
* Code (any language) ("lastname_firstname_dawai_week01_ftdata.py or .R"), scripts or notebooks also OK. (2p)
* One para text on experience with AI: what model you used, was easy, where was human interaction needed. ("lastname_firstname_dawai_week01_ftdata.txt or .md") (4p)
