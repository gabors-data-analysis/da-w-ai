title: "Reproduce an FT graph"
---

Look at [this graph](/week01/assets/ft-liberation-day-usd-yield-2025-04-11.jpg) from Financial Times. Your task is to recreate this figure using real-world data. 

Use AI as your assistant to find real-world data that matches or closely resembles the one used in the FT graph, and recreate the same chart using that data.

**what to submit**

* Graph: A PDF version of your recreated graph, name it: "lastname_firstname_dawai_week01_ftfigure.pdf"
* Data: A CSV file with the data used to create the graph, with the name ("lastname_firstname_dawai_week01_ftdata.csv")
* One para text on experience with AI: what model you used, was easy, where was human interaction needed. ("lastname_firstname_dawai_week01_ftdata.txt or .md")
* Code (any language) ("lastname_firstname_dawai_week01_ftdata.py or .R"), scripts or notebooks also OK.
