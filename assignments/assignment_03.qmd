This is a **group** assignment.  Continue with the research question you had chosen in class. 

Use AI iteratively to *help* you create a report. 

### First run

  * Think in terms of two variables ($x$ and $y$). 
    * Pick a single variable or a combined index of variables
    * Pick a GDP variable
    * Think about a causal link. 
  * Create one carefully designed graph to illustrate the relationship (Graph 1)
  * At each step, explain your choices/decisions (ie why you chose a certain variable)
  * Create a Conclusion paragraph where you summarize your work and results in 80-100 words.
* create another graph to show heterogeneity of country size groups using population (Graph 2)
* Run a regression and interpret the coefficient. Make sure they are precise. 
* Use AI to get a well cratfted folder structure

### Extended context window run 1

* create a system prompt will preferences, expected output, style, etc
* recreate a the report

### Extended context window run 2

* Once you have a draft, Upload slideshow for chapters 10 [data analysis slides](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/chapters/).  and ask to follow it and revise report. 
* recreate a the report

### Final repor

* You have three versions. Use them to have a single one you like the most. Edit further if needed. 

### To submit

1. report of maximum 2 pages in .pdf format (including exhibits) (lastname_firstname_dawai_week03_report.pdf) (12p)
2. your code (or provide a link). (2p)
3. Text: What advice would you give to a fellow data analysis student on using AI to create a report? (How do various runs compare? What changes are decisive? How many iterations and useful?) (lastname_firstname_dawai_week03_advice.txt) (6p).
    
* Upload your report to the `student folder called Reports` at moodle or similar service if applicable. This is for the next class --- each group will read another groups report and discuss the good and bad aspects of the report.

### AI use restrictions

* For the report, use AI as your assistant, use it as *input* not as *output*. Don't submit an AI-generated report without review and edit. 
* Do not use AI to help you generate the advice. We want to hear your personal examples and reflections, not AI-generated suggestions.
