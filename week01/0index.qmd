## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, students will:

-   Understand core concepts and architecture behind large language models (LLMs)
-   Learn how to incorporate AI into data analysis workflows\
-   Critically assess capabilities and limitations of AI tools in academic contexts
-   Experience the "jagged frontier" of LLM capabilities through hands-on practice

**The Financial Times Challenge**

Take a look at this excellent [Financial Times visualization](assets/ft-liberation-day-usd-yield-2025-04-11.jpg) showing the market reaction to Trump's tariff announcements.

**Your Mission:**

Reproduce this chart as accurately as possible in the shortest time using AI assistance.

**Learning Goals:**

-   Experience AI-assisted data visualization
-   Practice prompt engineering for specific tasks
-   Understand the balance between human direction and AI execution, risks of relying too much on AI

## Preparation

::: {.callout-tip icon="üí°"}
## Before Class

-   No specific preparation required for Week 1
-   Come ready to discuss your current experience with AI tools
-   Bring examples of where you've encountered AI in your work/studies
:::

## Discussion Questions

Consider these questions as you engage with the materials:

1.  **Personal AI Experience:** How have you already incorporated AI into your routine? Which model feels most natural to you?

2.  **Error Management:** How do you currently deal with AI hallucinations or imperfect answers?

3.  **The Jagged Frontier:** What tasks do you expect AI to excel at? Where do you think it will struggle?

## Tools and Resources

**Recommended AI Platforms for this course:**

-   **ChatGPT 4o/o1** - Excellent for coding and data analysis
-   **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** - Great for research and writing tasks\
-   **GitHub Copilot** - For integrated coding assistance

**Getting Started:**

-   Most tasks can be accomplished with free tiers
-   Consider paid subscriptions for intensive work (\$20/month typical)
-   See [AI Model Comparison Guide](assets/which-ai.html) for detailed recommendations

## Week 1 Outcomes

By completing Week 1, you should:

-   ‚úÖ Understand what LLMs can and cannot do reliably
-   ‚úÖ Have experience with AI-assisted data visualization\
-   ‚úÖ Recognize the importance of human oversight in AI workflows
-   ‚úÖ Be prepared to use AI as a collaborative tool throughout the course
