# Week01: Review of LLM and their use in Data Analysis


## Objectives 

### Summary

This class introduces key concepts of large language models (LLMs) and explores how AI can support data analysis. Through hands-on tasks and critical discussion, students will learn how to effectively integrate LLMs into coding, documentation, and research workflows, and understand both the potential and limitations of these tools.

### Learning Objectives:

- Understand the core concepts and architecture behind large language models (LLMs).
- Get a structure how to incorporate AI in your workflow
- Critically assess the capabilities, limitations of AI tools in academic and professional contexts.
  
## Preparation BEFORE class

* None

### Task

Take a look at this [great chart by FT](/week01/assets/ft-liberation-day-usd-yield-2025-04-11.jpg) on US President Trump's tariff announcement and financial markets. 

The task is to get a reproduction as good as possible in as little time as possible. 


## End of class discussion topics

* How have you incorporated AI in your routine, which model is closest?
* How do you deal with hallucinations / not perefect answers?
