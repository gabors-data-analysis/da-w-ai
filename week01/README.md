# Week01: Review of LLM and their use in Data Analysis


## Objectives 

### Summary

This class introduces key concepts of large language models (LLMs) and explores how AI can support data analysis. Through hands-on tasks and critical discussion, students will learn how to effectively integrate LLMs into coding, documentation, and research workflows, and understand both the potential and limitations of these tools.

### Learning Objectives:

- Understand the core concepts and architecture behind large language models (LLMs).
- Get a structure how to incorporate AI in your workflow
- Critically assess the capabilities, limitations of AI tools in academic and professional contexts.
