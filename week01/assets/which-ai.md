# Which AI model shall we chose? 

In what follows, here is my personal take as of `date:2025-05-22`

Generative AI based on Large Language Models (genAI) is great for many tasks. In this course we only focus on aspects of Data Analysis:

* designing analysis
* writing code
* data wrangling such as joining tables, sample design, variable transformations
* exploratory data analysis
* modelling, regressions, machine learning
* causal inference
* creating tables and graphs
* writing reports and presentations


## Different AI providers and their models

### OpenAI ChatGPT

The main current models are `4o`, `o3`, and `4.1`


### Anthropic Claude

The main current model is Claude Sonnet 3.7. 

Key tools
* Projects: organize files, allow inquiry. One example is full codebase. 

### Others

There are many other models, but I have much less experience. 

## Free vs Pro?
