In what follows, here is my personal take as of `date:2025-05-22`

Generative AI based on Large Language Models (genAI) is great for many tasks. In this course we only focus on aspects of Data Analysis:

* designing analysis
* writing code
* data wrangling such as joining tables, sample design, variable transformations
* exploratory data analysis
* modelling, regressions, machine learning
* causal inference
* creating tables and graphs
* writing reports and presentations


## Different AI providers and their models

### OpenAI ChatGPT

The main current models are `4o`, `o3`, and `4.1`

Here's an updated, compact guide including **o3**, **o4-mini-high**, **GPT-4.5**, and **Deep Research**:

*Here ChatGPT's quick guide to when and why to use which model*

#### üîç **Model Overview**

| **Model**            | **Strengths**                                                          | **Use When**                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **GPT-4-turbo (4o)** | Fast, accurate, handles long prompts and code well                     | Default for coding, EDA, modeling, teaching     |
| **GPT-4.5**          | Slightly better reasoning and math; not always faster                  | More complex logic, multi-step planning         |
| **GPT-4 (base)**     | Stable, reliable for structured work                                   | You need consistent responses (e.g., templates) |
| **o3**               | Compact, efficient, more creative but can be fuzzy                     | Brainstorming, creative prompt design           |
| **o4-mini-high**     | Lightweight, fast, good for quick checks or when resources are limited | Instant feedback, code sketching                |
| **Deep Research**    | Access to full documents, citations, deep factual retrieval            | Literature reviews, technical deep-dives        |


### ‚úÖ **Best Model by Task**

| **Task**                      | **Best Model(s)**           | **Notes**                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Designing analysis            | 4o / GPT-4.5                | Handles multi-step reasoning well                         |
| Writing code (R, Python, SQL) | 4o / GPT-4.5 / o4-mini-high | Use 4o for tidyverse-heavy tasks; o4-mini for quick draft |
| Data wrangling                | 4o                          | Very good with `dplyr`, `data.table`, `pandas`            |
| Exploratory data analysis     | 4o + code interpreter       | Visuals, summaries, and diagnostics                       |
| Modeling (ML, regressions)    | GPT-4.5 / 4o                | Clear, structured models and diagnostics                  |
| Causal inference              | GPT-4.5 / 4o                | Handles DiD, IV, RDD, matching logic well                 |
| Creating tables and graphs    | 4o / GPT-4.5                | Knows LaTeX, Markdown, ggplot2, matplotlib formatting     |
| Writing reports / slides      | 4o / GPT-4 / o3             | 4o for clarity, o3 for more creative text generation      |
| Literature search / citations | **Deep Research**           | Finds, summarizes, and cites academic papers              |




### Anthropic Claude

The main current model is Claude Sonnet 3.7. 

Key tools
* Projects: organize files, allow inquiry. One example is full codebase. 

### Others

There are many other models, but I have much less experience. 

## Free vs Pro? 

The current free models are great for many tasks such as coding, idea generation.

### ChatGPT

The free version offers: access to GPT‚Äë4.1 mini, real-time data from the web with search. Plus
* Limited access to GPT‚Äë4o, OpenAI o4-mini, and deep research
* Limited access to file uploads, data analysis,

The [Plus version](https://openai.com/chatgpt/pricing/) offers
* access to reasoning models  (OpenAI o3, OpenAI o4-mini, and OpenAI o4-mini-high)
* access Deep Research
* higher limits on advanced features:  file uploads, and data analysis
* access to a research preview of GPT‚Äë4.5
* access to GPT‚Äë4.1, a model optimized for coding tasks
* can create and use projects, tasks, 

### Claude

The free model can be used for chat and data analysis. 

The paid tier for Claude

* More usage -- for details see [limits](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9797557-usage-limit-best-practices)
* access to Projects to organize chats and documents
* web access
* extended thinking for complex work

## Other cool stuff I use

### Notebook LM

[Google's Notebook LM] (https://notebooklm.google/) is able to "understand" and summarize any material (such as research paper) and relate it to other topics. Can create fun audo summaries like a podcast. Here is one on a [research paper of mine on cultural homophily](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/655d48f9-bff7-4ac3-908b-5b9bc48e5be4/audio). 

### Github Copilot

Github Copilot goes inside your code editor such as Rstudio, VSCode, Jupyter Notebook and helps writing code. Great to write frequent stuff like loops or graphs. 

It has an Education -- free access for students: [GithubEducation](https://github.com/education/students)

### Cursor 

[Cursor AI](https://www.cursor.com/) is the most popular AI code editor, I have very limited experience, but is favored by software developers. 

## Feedback
Dear Reader. I have limited experience. Suggestions are welcome, please post an issue.
