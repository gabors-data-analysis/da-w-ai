title: "Which AI model shall we chose?"

In what follows, here is my personal take as of `date:2026-01-12`.


## Basics

Generative AI based on Large Language Models (genAI) is great for many tasks. In this course we only focus on aspects of Data Analysis:

* designing analysis
* writing code
* data wrangling such as joining tables, sample design, variable transformations
* exploratory data analysis
* modelling, regressions, machine learning
* causal inference
* creating tables and graphs
* writing reports and presentations


## Basics

* Most models have a free and paid tiers. Free ones are good as kind of Google search replacement. For serious work you'll be better off with paid tiers. 
* As of now the leading models are Google's Gemini 3.0, OpenAI's GPT-5.2, and Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5.
* Each model have faster (cheaper) and thinking (more expensive) variants. For data analysis work, the thinking variants are recommended.
* All major models have deep research 
* All major models support tool use (e.g. web browsing, code execution) and agentic patterns (multi-step workflows with memory and tool use).
* Open weights models are also quite good, Deepseek and Q. You can even run a 7bn parameter model on an expensive computer

## landscape overview

| Feature | **GPT-5.2** | **o3** (reasoning) | **Gemini 3 Deep Think** | **Claude Opus 4.5** |
|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|
| **Design focus** | Flagship multimodal with native reasoning | Deep reasoning for complex tasks | 1M token context with extended thinking | Coding & complex instruction following |
| **Multimodality** | Text + images + audio + video (I/O) | Text + tool calls | Text + images + video | Text + images + Computer Use 2.0 |
| **Browsing / tools** | Integrated search + MCP support | Auto-search for up-to-date facts | Grounded in Google Search | Deep integration with MCP & OS |
| **Default style** | Balanced, adaptive | Concise, source-cited | Thorough, exploratory | Professional, highly structured |
| **Context window** | 400k tokens | 128k tokens | 1M tokens | 500k tokens |
| **Strengths** | All-rounder, agentic workflows | Step-wise analysis, audit trail | Long-context research | Coding agents, OS automation |
| **Weak spots** | Expensive for simple tasks | No native media I/O | Slower response times | Slower than Haiku/Sonnet |

## Models for data analysis

For data-analysis projects, the recommended approach is:

-   **Reasoning models (o3, Deep Think)** for complex analysis requiring accuracy
-   **GPT-5.2** for agentic workflows and multimodal tasks\
-   **Gemini 3** for long-context document analysis (entire datasets, reports)
-   **Claude Opus 4.5** for coding and complex technical writing

All major models now support tool use (MCP) and agentic patterns.

## Research & Writing {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

* **Synthesis Over Summarization**: AI tools increasingly synthesize multi-source inputs into structured insights rather than paraphrasing single documents.
* **Security & Privacy**: Modern workspaces rely on **isolated execution contexts**; strong non-training guarantees apply primarily to paid and enterprise tiers.
* **Multimodal Capability**: AI can interpret charts, screenshots, and handwritten notes and incorporate them into drafts.

## For data analysis workspaces -- comparison 

| Workspace | 2026 Key Features |
|:---|:---|
| **Anthropic Claude Artifacts** | • Creates **interactive applications** (tutors, calculators) within the output window.<br>• Real-time iteration on complex document structures. |
| **OpenAI ChatGPT Canvas** | • Advanced frontier models with contextual persistence for tone and style.<br>• Inline editing with granular control over specific sections. |
| **Google NotebookLM** | • **Interactive Audio Overviews** with user interruption and questioning.<br>• Grounded citations linked directly to uploaded source segments. |
| **Perplexity Pages** | • Multi-source synthesis using live web retrieval.<br>• Inline citation and consistency checking against sources. |


## Data Analysis details {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

* **Sandboxed Execution**: Code runs in secure, ephemeral environments with no local system access.
* **Statistical Rigor**: Strong support for Python-based libraries (e.g. pandas, scikit-learn) for exploratory and predictive analysis.
* **Direct Integration**: AI can manipulate data directly within spreadsheets or dedicated analysis windows.
* **Limits**: Reproducibility, package versions, and state persistence remain constrained relative to local workflows.

## Data Analysis details {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

| Workspace | 2026 Key Features for Analysis |
|:---|:---|
| **ChatGPT Data Analysis** | • Executes Python in managed compute environments for multi-file datasets.<br>• Assisted data cleaning and predictive modeling workflows. |
| **Claude Analysis** | • High-fidelity **SVG and lightweight interactive output**.<br>• Fast iteration on statistical tables with publication-ready formatting. |
| **Google Gemini in Sheets** | • **Multimodal cleaning**: converts screenshots or PDFs into structured tables.<br>• Natural-language formula generation and transformations. |
| **Microsoft Copilot in Excel** | • **Native Python-in-Excel** for statistical scripts inside spreadsheets.<br>• Automated pivots, summaries, and forecasting via prompts. |


## Coding Assistance {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

* **Agent-Assisted Workflows**: AI can coordinate multi-step tasks such as refactoring or bug fixing across large codebases, with human review.
* **Environment Security**: Code is tested in **secure sandboxes** before changes are proposed.
* **Interconnected Tools**: Integrated with development and collaboration platforms (e.g. Jira, Slack).

| Workspace | 2026 Key Features for Developers |
|:---|:---|
| **Anthropic Claude Code** | • Native **VS Code extension** with agent-style workflows and inline diffs.<br>• Supports complex multi-file edits and testing assistance. |
| **GitHub Copilot** | • Uses **Extensions** to interact with external dev tools (Azure, Slack, Jira).<br>• Deep context from local and remote repositories. |
| **Cursor** | • AI-first editor with awareness of project-wide dependencies.<br>• Strong support for iterative refactors across files. |
| **Windsurf (Codeium)** | • **Cascade mode** for orchestrating large-scale refactors.<br>• Robust free tier for students and individual users. |

**Security note:** SOC2 compliance is common; strict zero-retention guarantees typically apply to enterprise or explicitly configured accounts.


## What changed from 2025 Q2

* No need to think much re which models to use. 
* Leading models similar capability, but different. Not really sure how...
