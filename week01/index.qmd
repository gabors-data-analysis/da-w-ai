## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, students will:

- Understand core concepts of large language models (LLMs)
- Distinguish between "Cyborg" and "Centaur" approaches to AI collaboration
- Experience the "jagged frontier" of LLM capabilities through hands-on practice
- Critically assess capabilities and limitations of AI tools in academic contexts

**This is Week 1** - come ready to explore and discuss!

 **Reflection Preparation:**

- Think about your current experience with AI tools (if any)
- Consider examples where you've encountered AI in your work/studies
- Identify one data analysis task you find time-consuming or repetitive

**Optional Background:**

- Ethan Mollick: "Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI" (Chapters 1-2)

**Key Topics Covered:**

- **What are LLMs?** Statistical models predicting next tokens from massive training data
- **The Transformer Revolution:** How 2017's "Attention is All You Need" changed everything
- **Context Windows:** why this matters for data analysis
- **Training Process:** Resources and human feedback

**Example**

Try this in a chat

```
Get me an income dataset by planning regions (county) in Connecticut for 2023. Present the results as a table I can copy and edit..
```

* Now try find the actual data and compare. 
* Try multiple times in different models
* Try modifying the prompt to be more specific or different

## Discussion Questions

**End of Week Reflection:**

1. **Personal AI Experience:** How have you already incorporated AI into your routine? Which model feels most natural to you?

2. **Error Management:** How do you currently deal with AI hallucinations or imperfect answers?  What strategies emerged during the FT graph exercise?

3. **The Jagged Frontier:** What tasks do you expect AI to excel at? Where do you think it will struggle?  Did the visualization exercise match your expectations?


## Assignment

::: {.callout-note icon="📝"}

### Academic Integrity and AI use

**Course Philosophy:**

- **AI as Assistant:** Use AI to enhance your capabilities, not replace your thinking
- **Maintain Authority:** You remain responsible for all outputs and interpretations
- **Verify Everything:** Always validate AI suggestions, especially statistical claims
- **Document Usage:** Keep track of how AI helped -- to learn (and for transparency)

**Red Lines:**

- Never submit unverified AI output as your own work
- Always understand the analysis you're presenting
- Avoid over-reliance on AI for critical thinking or interpretation (**you be you**)

**The Goal:** 

Become a more capable data analyst who can leverage AI tools effectively while maintaining scientific rigor.

**Next Week:** 

[Week 2 - Data Discovery and Documentation](../week02/) where we'll use AI to understand and document complex datasets.

## Some personal comments on AI and this class

* I needed to rewrite, edit the slideshow frequently. Bloody hell, this course material is tricky. (While [Gosset's t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test) has been around since 1908...)
* It was an AI (Claude Sonnet 4.0) that suggest to include the last bit on Academic Integrity and red lines. Hahh.
