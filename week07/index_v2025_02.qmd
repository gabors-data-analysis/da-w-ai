## About the class

Remember Week 4? You learned how to join tables - combining hotels with cities, occupancy data with hotel info. You used AI chat to understand concepts and help write code.

This week, we level up.

**Claude Code** is an agentic AI - instead of chatting back and forth, it works directly with your files. It reads your CSVs, writes code, runs it, sees errors, fixes them, and iterates until done. You'll redo the kind of analysis from Week 4, but faster and with a new superpower: **generating your own data tables**.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, students will:

* Understand the difference between chat-based AI and agentic AI
* Install and use Claude Code for data analysis
* Revisit table joins with a more powerful workflow
* Generate realistic simulated data that joins to existing datasets
* Experience rapid iteration: explore → generate → join → analyze

### Before class

::: {.week-card .card}
::: {.card-header}
**Setup Required - Do This Before Class**
:::
::: {.card-body}

**1. Install Claude Code**

Follow our setup guide: [Setting Up Claude Code](../da-knowledge/setting-up-claude-code.html)

You need:

- Node.js installed
- Claude Code installed via `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- A Claude Pro subscription or API access
- Logged in (run `claude` and follow prompts)

**2. Install Python (if you don't have it)**

Claude Code writes and runs Python, so Python must be on your machine.

- Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Download the latest version
- **Important:** Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
- Verify in a new terminal: `python --version`

Install data packages:
```
python -m pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

**3. Have your Austrian Hotels data ready**

You should still have this from Week 4. If not, download [data-modified.zip](../case-studies/austria-hotels/data/data-modified.zip) and unzip.

## Class Plan

::: {.week-card .card}
::: {.card-header}
**Part 1: From Chat to Agent (15 min)**
:::
::: {.card-body}

### Remember Week 4?

In Week 4, you:

- Asked ChatGPT/Claude to explain joins
- Copied data descriptions into chat
- Got code back, pasted it, ran it
- Hit errors, copied them back, got fixes
- Repeated until it worked

**That works. But there's a better way.**

### Enter Claude Code

| Week 4 Workflow | Week 7 Workflow |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Describe your data to AI | AI reads your files directly |
| Copy-paste code | AI writes and runs code |
| Copy error messages | AI sees and fixes errors |
| Manual iteration | Automatic iteration |
| Start fresh each session | AI remembers the project |

### Quick Demo

The instructor will show: "Join hotels and cities, then calculate average occupancy by province"

- **Chat way:** Multiple copy-pastes, ~5 minutes
- **Claude Code way:** One prompt, ~30 seconds

**Part 2: Redo Week 4, But Better (20 min)**
:::
::: {.card-body}

### Getting Started

Open terminal, navigate to your data:
```
cd path/to/austrian-hotels-data
claude
```

### Exercise 1: Explore (5 min)

```
What CSV files are here? Summarize each one briefly.
```

```
How can these tables be joined? What are the keys?
```

### Exercise 2: Joins Revisited (15 min)

Try these - notice how much faster it is:

**1:1 Join**
```
Join hotels and cities. Compare left join vs inner join - which hotels disappear with inner join and why?
```

**1:m Join**
```
Join hotels with monthly_occupancy. What's the average occupancy rate for 5-star vs 3-star hotels?
```

**Composite Key**
```
Create a city-month-year summary showing average occupancy, tourist arrivals, and economic indicators. This requires joining multiple tables.
```

**Discuss:** What took 30 minutes in Week 4 takes how long now?

**Part 3: The New Superpower - Generate Data (30 min)**
:::
::: {.card-body}

### Why Generate Data?

Real datasets are messy and incomplete. Sometimes you need:

- Training data for testing your code
- Simulated scenarios ("what if occupancy dropped 20%?")
- Additional tables that don't exist yet

Claude Code can create realistic data that joins properly to your existing tables.

### Demo: Creating Booking Channel Data

Watch the instructor generate a new table:

```
Create a CSV called hotel_bookings.csv showing what percentage of
each hotel's bookings come from different channels: Direct, Booking.com,
Expedia, HRS, Travel Agent.

Rules:
- Each hotel has one row per channel
- Percentages sum to 100% per hotel
- 5-star hotels: more direct bookings (35-45%)
- 3-star hotels: more OTA reliance (Booking.com 35-45%)
- Include commission rates (Direct=0%, OTAs vary 10-18%)
- Use hotels_modified.csv for the hotel list

Generate Python code, run it, and show me summary stats.
```

### Exercise 3: Create Your Own Table (Groups of 2-3, 20 min)

**Pick one idea or invent your own:**

| Table | Join Key | What to Include |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| **Weather** | city + month + year | Temperature, rain, snow. Ski towns cold in winter! |
| **Staff** | hotel_id | Employees, languages spoken. More stars = more staff |
| **Events** | city + month + year | Festivals, conferences. Vienna has more events |
| **Renovations** | hotel_id | Year renovated, cost. Older hotels renovated more recently |
| **Guest nationality** | hotel_id | % of guests from each country. Varies by city |

**Steps:**

1. Discuss with your group: What patterns should be realistic?
2. Write a detailed prompt (be specific about the patterns!)
3. Have Claude Code generate and run the code
4. Check: Does it look right? Run some summaries
5. Join it to hotels and do one quick analysis

**Part 4: Quick Analysis Challenge (15 min)**
:::
::: {.card-body}

### Put It Together

Using your newly generated table, answer an interesting question:

**Examples:**

- "Do hotels in cities with more events have higher occupancy?"
- "Is there a correlation between staff count and review ratings?"
- "Do direct bookings correlate with star rating?"

Ask Claude Code to:

1. Join the relevant tables
2. Calculate the statistics
3. Create a simple visualization
4. Interpret the results

**Tip:** If results look wrong, ask Claude Code to check row counts and show intermediate steps.

## Discussion Questions

1. **Speed vs Control:** Claude Code is faster, but do you feel less in control? Is that a problem?

2. **Verification:** How do you know the generated data is realistic? What checks did you run?

3. **When to use what:** After today, when would you use Claude Code vs ChatGPT/Claude.ai?

4. **Data generation ethics:** When is it OK to use simulated data? When is it not?


## Assignment

::: {.callout-note icon="assignment"}
## Assignment 7: Mini Data Project

[Full Assignment Details](../assignments/assignment_07.html){.assignment-badge}

**In brief:** Design and execute a small data project using Claude Code. Generate at least one new data table, join it with existing data, and answer a question you find interesting.

## Notes

* This class builds directly on Week 4. If joins still feel shaky, review that material first.
* The Austrian Hotels dataset was itself generated by Claude (an earlier version). We're going full circle.
* Setup issues? Don't panic. The teaching team can help during the first 15 minutes of class.
