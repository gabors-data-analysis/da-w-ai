2. Data: [WVS_random_subset.csv](https://osf.io/3ax7b) - random subset from each country, small version
3. Download its official documentation  

## Ask AI

* Start asking for skeleton readme, like [Good Readme](https://chatgpt.com/share/67bc35fc-080c-8000-8e06-30b997c6781e)
* Take a picture of a repo and ask to add
* Write a full prompt following iterations
