# Documenting data and code: discovery and README with AI

## Objectives 

### Summary

You will learn how to write a clear and professional README for a cleaned subset of the 7th Wave of the World Values Survey (WVS)

### Learning Objectives:

* Understand how to document a new dataset using as an example th WVS 7th wave data.
* Create a README that describes data.
* Learn to refine documentation by incorporating iterative feedback from peers and AI tools.

## Preparation BEFORE class

### Reading and review

* Background reading: Békés-Kézdi (2021) Chapters 1-3, in particular [core background info](/week02/assets/da-background.md) 
* Some discussion of data types [Data Management in Large-Scale Education Research](https://datamgmtinedresearch.com/structure) by Crystal Lewis
* Some ideas on readme:  [Makereadme](https://www.makeareadme.com/), [Social Science Editors](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/)
  
### Get data and info: 

Access the following datasets from [OSF, Gabors Data Analysis / World Values Survey](https://osf.io/mfd6s/) 
1. Data [WVS_subset.csv](https://osf.io/67pje) - subset of the 7th Wave of WVS dataset 
2. Data: [WVS_random_subset.csv](https://osf.io/3ax7b) - random subset from each country, small version
3. Download its official documentation  

## Class plan (60 mins)

### No AI

* Download and look at the Random Subset data
* Start collecting some info on the data

### AI: Learning and idea generation

* Start asking for skeleton readme, like [Good Readme](https://chatgpt.com/share/67bc35fc-080c-8000-8e06-30b997c6781e)
* Take a picture of a repo and ask to add
* Write a full prompt following iterations

### Cyborg mode: create a readme with AI
* Get AI to design a README TEMPLATE for this task.
* Get a draft
* Understand draft
