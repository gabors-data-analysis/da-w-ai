## About the class

Data wrangling is the process of preparing data for the analysis. A key task is joining data tables. It looks simple, but in practice, has many challenges. AI can help design the process, and give you code to do that. 


### Objectives summary: 

Learn how to organize data in a tidy way, join multiple datasets,  choose variables to answer a research question and create a reproducible workflow to analyze data.

### Learning Objectives

* Learn how to store information in a tidy way.
* Work with relational data.
* Join tables
* Use AI to explain complex concepts

### Before class 

* Background reading: B√©k√©s-K√©zdi (2021) Chapter 2
* Download `data-modified.zip` from [Here](/data/austria-hotels).  Unzip. It is a set of csv files such as 'cities_modified'
  * Also available on Moodle
* The data [description is available here](/data/austria-hotels/hotel-data-readme.md) -- have a look before class

### Recap

Discuss assignment 03 (20 mins by groups + 10 mins together)

* Create 3-4-member groups. Each groups will read reports by an another team (1-->2, 2-->3, ... , N-->1)
* Read the other team's submissions with a 'reader's perspective' and take notes. 
 * Which report did you like the most and why
 * Rank reports in terms of how much AI was involved from low to high and note suspicious examples 
* Note examples where AI usage was obvious (even made things worse) vs. well-integrated.

### Task 1: Use AI to understand these terms. Ask examples. (Individual)

* tidy data table
* relational datasets,
  * schema,
  * primary and foreign key
  * composite key
* joining tables
  * different types of join
  * 1:1, 1:m
* joining tables in your language (python, R, Stata)
* difficulties of generating primary keys

This is followed by a discussion.

## Task 2: Form 2-3 groups of people using same coding language

Use the data you downloaded to carry out joins and inspect results. Use AI but inspect. 

## 1:1

1. Join hotels and cities. Compare left, right, inner, outer joins. 
  *  what happens to N?
  *  compare all four join types - which hotels/cities disappear with each approach?

## 1:m

2. Start: Tabulate the frequency of hotels by city_hotel_counts

3. Cities to Hotels
  * one city joins to multiple hotels
  * filter on 2 cities for easier visibility

4. Join hotel and occupancy 1
  * m:1

5. Join hotel and occupancy  2
  * get hotel level
  * trick: aggregate 

6. Join on composite key

* create a data table at city-year-match level showing average occupancy and tourist arrivals
* can you include economic indicators by month?

## Advice, ideas

* discuss and collect ideas from  AI
* learn to focus on key suggestions (AI can go nuanced and not important points easily)

## End of Week Discussion points

* How useful was AI in teaching skills?
* How useful was AI in actually joining tables?
* How can you debug what AI did in terms of executing code? 
* When joins produced unexpected row counts, how did you diagnose the problem? What AI prompts helped most?


## Some personal comments on AI and this class

* You may wonder why this topic? I'll tell you. David Card, Nobel-prize winning economist visited me at CEU. I asked what I shall I add to my textbook. Some new fancy econometric method? He said in his experience, people have the hardest time joining tables, and in business applications, it's crucial. 
* This is also a place to show how AI can help expanding on key concepts. One must know about the problem of joining tables. But what is left vs right, what is primary vs secondary key -- well ask AI.
