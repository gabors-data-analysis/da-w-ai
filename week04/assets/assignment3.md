## Assignment 3: slideshow on results and joins

* Create groups of 2-3 people who use the same coding language. 

### taks
* Ask AI to give you a list of research questions that can be answered using many (at least 4) of the hotel data sets provided. Iterate with AI to find an interesting question using a persona. 

* Write code that joins the required data
* Write code to do the analysis (conditional comparison / some simple regression)

* Produce a figure that shows the answer (or a simple version of the answer) to the research question (e.g. scatterplot and regression line, or boxplot, etc)

* Create a min. 6 - max. 10 pages slide show to illustrate the research question, the merging process, the figure and the conclusion.

### Hint
For example, you can use the following slide show structure, each bit is 1-2 slides:
* Research question and why/for whom you picked it
* Data and variables
* Detailed steps of joining tables to get to the work data (here be specific, 2-4 slides)
* Steps of creating my variables for analysis
* Result and interpretation

### Submit: 
1. Slideshow in pdf format: “lastname1_lastname2_lastname3_slides.pdf”
2. Reproducible code “lastname1_lastname2_lastname3_code.pdf”
