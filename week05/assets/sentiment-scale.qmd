title: "General Sentiment Rating Guidelines"
---

## Task:
Please read each text carefully and rate the overall sentiment of the manager's statement as **positive** or **negative**. Your rating should reflect the **manager's expressed tone**, not your judgment of the match.

## Rating Scale:

| **Score** | **Meaning** |
|----------|------------|
| **2** | Strongly positive sentiment (clear optimism, satisfaction, praise). |
| **1** | Mildly positive sentiment (generally positive, slight reservations). |
| **0** | Neutral or unclear sentiment. |
| **-1** | Mildly negative sentiment (general disappointment, frustration). |
| **-2** | Strongly negative sentiment (clear criticism, significant disappointment). |
