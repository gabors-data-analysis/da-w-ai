## Overview

Last week we introduced agentic AI with Claude Code -- running AI in the terminal that can see files, run code, and iterate. This week we go deeper: **custom skills**, **project-specific instructions**, **git integration**, and **autonomous execution**. These features turn CLI tools from clever assistants into reproducible research companions.

The focus is on **Claude Code**, with notes on Gemini CLI equivalents where relevant.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of the session, students will:

- Create custom skills (reusable workflows) for their data analysis projects
- Set up project-specific instructions with `CLAUDE.md` / `GEMINI.md`
- Use git integration for version-controlled, traceable analysis
- Understand autonomous execution modes and when to use them

## Preparation / Before Class

::: {.week-card .card}
::: {.card-header}
🔧 **Prerequisites**
:::
::: {.card-body}
**Required:**

- Working Claude Code installation from [Week 04](../week04/index.html)
- Basic familiarity with running Claude Code in a project directory
- A project folder with at least one data file and one script

**Recommended Reading:**

- [Advanced CLI Workflows reference page](../da-knowledge/cli-advanced-workflows.html) -- the full reference guide for today's topics
- [Installing CLI Tools](../da-knowledge/install-cli.html) -- if you need to catch up

## Class Material

::: {.week-card .card}
::: {.card-header}
🛠️ **Custom Skills and Reusable Workflows (25 min)**
:::
::: {.card-body}
**What are skills?**

Skills are reusable instruction sets that Claude Code can load automatically or on demand. Each skill lives in a `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` file.

**Scope:**

- **Personal:** `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` (available in all your projects)
- **Project:** `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` (this repo only)

**Hands-on: Create a `/clean-data` skill**

Create `.claude/skills/clean-data/SKILL.md` in your project:

```markdown
---
name: clean-data
description: Run the data cleaning pipeline for this project.
---

Run the data cleaning pipeline:
1. Check for missing values in raw data files
2. Run data_cleaning.R script
3. Verify output file dimensions
4. Generate a data quality report
```

Now typing `/clean-data` in Claude Code executes this workflow consistently.

**Discussion:** What repetitive analysis tasks could you turn into skills?

**Gemini CLI equivalent:** MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers -- external processes that expose tools to the AI.

📋 **Project-Specific Instructions: CLAUDE.md (20 min)**
:::
::: {.card-body}
**The idea:** Instead of repeating preferences in every prompt, write them once in a `CLAUDE.md` file. Claude Code reads it automatically.

**Example for a data analysis project:**

```markdown
## Code Style
- Use tidyverse syntax for R code
- Use pandas for Python data manipulation
- Prefer ggplot2 with viridis color scheme

## Data Standards
- All dates in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Column names: lowercase with underscores

## Analysis Preferences
- Always check for missing values before analysis
- Report sample sizes in all tables
```

**Hierarchical loading:** Global (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`) → Project (`./CLAUDE.md`) → Subdirectory. More specific settings override general ones.

**Hands-on:** Create a `CLAUDE.md` for one of the course case studies (e.g., Austrian Hotels or Football Interviews).

**Gemini CLI equivalent:** `GEMINI.md` -- same concept, same locations.

::: {.week-card .card}
::: {.card-header}
🔀 **Git Integration (20 min)**
:::
::: {.card-body}
**Why it matters:** Version control + AI = traceable, reproducible analysis. Claude Code understands git natively.

**Branch management:**

```
Create a new branch for the robustness checks analysis,
implement the checks, and prepare a summary of changes
```

Claude Code will create the branch, make changes, commit with descriptive messages, and provide a diff summary.

**Understanding project history:**

```
Look at the git history for data_cleaning.R.
Why did we change the outlier detection threshold?
```

Claude Code reads commit messages and diffs to understand past decisions -- useful when revisiting old projects.

**Hands-on:** Use Claude Code to create a branch, make an analysis change, and commit with a meaningful message. Review the diff together.

🚀 **Autonomous Execution (15 min)**
:::
::: {.card-body}
**The concept:** Both tools can run commands without constant approval -- useful for trusted, repetitive workflows.

**Gemini CLI "Yolo Mode"** (`--yolo` or `-y`):

```bash
gemini -p "Install missing packages, clean the data, run all analyses" --yolo
```

**Claude Code headless mode:**

```bash
claude -p "your prompt"
```

**When to use autonomous execution:**

- Trusted, repetitive pipelines you've run before
- Well-defined tasks with clear success criteria

**When NOT to:**

- New or unfamiliar code
- Tasks that modify shared resources
- Anything you haven't verified manually first

**Discussion:** What are the risks of autonomous execution in a research context? How do you balance speed with verification?

## End of Week Discussion Points

- How could custom skills improve reproducibility in your research?
- What instructions would you put in your `CLAUDE.md` for your thesis/project?
- When is autonomous execution appropriate vs. risky in data analysis?
- How does git integration change the way you think about AI-assisted analysis?
