## Overview

In this lesson, students will be introduced to sentiment analysis, specifically applied to evaluating general positivity or negativity in football managers' statements about match outcomes.

**New this week:** We'll use Claude Code (or similar CLI tools like Gemini CLI) to process texts directly from files, making the human-vs-AI comparison more streamlined.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of the session, students will:

- Understand core NLP concepts: tokenization, preprocessing, bag-of-words, and feature extraction in practical context.
- Gain hands-on experience with sentiment analysis.
- Understand the complexities and limitations of sentiment analysis.
- Use agentic AI to process text files directly

## Preparation / Before Class

::: {.week-card .card}
::: {.card-header}
📚 **Background Reading**
:::
::: {.card-body}
**No specific readings required** - we'll learn by doing

- No need for natural language processing background.
- Thinking ahead: How would you manually determine if someone sounds "positive" or "negative" about something?

**Have Claude Code ready** (from Week 7) or install now:

- [Setting Up Claude Code](../da-knowledge/setting-up-claude-code.html)
- Alternatives: Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI

**Why CLI tools for text analysis?**

- Read text files directly (no copy-paste)
- Process multiple texts in one go
- Save results to CSV automatically
- Iterate on prompts quickly

**Key Learning Points:**

- Fancy graphs != good graphs (good graph ← careful design)
- Precise interpretation >> BS
- Less is more
- Show only what you understand deeply

**Less is More Principle:** Simplicity often reveals insights better than complexity

## Class Material

::: {.week-card .card}
::: {.card-header}
📊 **Materials Setup**
:::
::: {.card-body}

 **Data Context:**

* These are real post-match interviews from Premier League managers discussing game results.
* Each text represents one manager's full response to journalists after a match.
* Preprocessing:  Replaced player and team names with "PLAYER" and "TEAM" - removes potential bias


**Practice Dataset:  Contains 5 post-match interviews from football managers**

- [Student test file (CSV)](/week05/assets/student_test_5.csv)
- [Student test file (Excel)](/week05/assets/student_test_5.xlsx)

**Reference Materials:**

- [General sentiment rating scale](/week05/assets/sentiment-scale.html) - our classification framework
- [Domain-specific lexicon](/case-studies/interviews/data/domain_lexicon.csv) - football-specific sentiment terms

**[Slideshow: Text to Data](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/courses/da-w-ai-2025/da-w-ai-05-text-to-data)**

**Key Concepts Covered:**

- **Tokenization:** Breaking text into meaningful units
- **Preprocessing:** Stemming, lemmatization, stop word removal
- **Bag of Words:** Converting text to numerical features
- **Domain knowledge:** Why football-specific terms matter
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Methods from simple dictionaries to AI models

**Practical Focus:** How these concepts apply to manager interviews

⚽ **Manual vs. AI Sentiment Workshop (40 min)**
:::
::: {.card-body}
**Phase 1: Human Rating (15 min)**

- **Individual work:** Rate the 5 provided manager statements using the [sentiment scale](/week05/assets/sentiment-scale.html)
- **5-unit scale:** -2 (very negative) to +2 (very positive)

**Phase 2: AI Rating with Claude Code (15 min)**

Instead of copy-pasting into a chat, use Claude Code:

```
cd path/to/your/data
claude
```

Then:
```
Read student_test_5.csv. For each interview text, rate the sentiment
on a scale from -2 (very negative) to +2 (very positive).

Use these guidelines:
- Consider the overall tone of the manager
- Football-specific phrases like "we dominated" are positive
- Phrases like "we were second best" are negative
- Neutrals discuss facts without emotional loading

Output a table with text_id, your rating, and a brief explanation.
```

**Compare:** How do Claude Code's ratings compare to your manual ratings?

**Phase 3: Domain Lexicon Exploration (10 min)**

Ask Claude Code to analyze the lexicon:
```
Read the domain_lexicon.csv file. Summarize what kinds of terms
are considered positive vs negative in football context.
Are there any surprises?
```

**Discussion: Validation and Sentiment Analysis**

- **Objective:** Discuss validation techniques used in sentiment analysis.
- **Topics for discussion:**
  - Differences between manual and AI ratings
  - Ground Truth
  - Introduction to validation methods:
  - If ground truth -- can do confusion matrix, calculate accuracy
  - If no ground truth -- measure **agreement** between humans and AI. test difference.
    - AI is average, but...
    - AI with persona?
    - AI biased ?

**Extra: Prediction of score**

If time permits: look at predicting score

- Modeling choices of results
- Think about *how* you would do it first
- Check how AI thinks about, rate the examples and look at explanations
- take the 5 examples, and compare your predictions vs the AI predictions

## End of Week Discussion points

- How precise is AI in sentiment analysis?
- How did *you* compare to AI in terms of scores? How did any difference make you feel?
- Can you think of a past project where AI could have helped you upgrade it?
-  Did AI provide consistent explanations for its ratings? When did its reasoning seem flawed? Did you feel it was mostly OK / half-truths?
- **New:** How did using Claude Code (reading files directly) change the workflow compared to chat?

## Assignment

::: {.callout-note icon="📝"}
## Assignment 5: Student-Specific Sentiment Analysis

**Due:** Before Week 6

Compare manual ratings with AI-generated ratings on your own random sample of 25 interview texts.

[Full Assignment Details](../assignments/assignment_05.html){.assignment-badge}

**CLI Option:** You may use Claude Code to batch-process your 25 texts instead of rating them one-by-one in chat.

## Some personal comments on AI and this class

* It's worth noting that my knowledge on NLP was bag of words, bigrams and TF-IDF. AI really helped making the jump.
* Using Claude Code to read the text files directly feels more like "real" data analysis than copy-pasting into a chat window.
