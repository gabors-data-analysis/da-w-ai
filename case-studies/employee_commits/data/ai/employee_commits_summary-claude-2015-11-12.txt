Your company faces a **critical productivity crisis driven by seniority and tenure**. While junior employees **show healthy growth** (commits increase with tenure, r=+0.35) and mid-level employees maintain **peak productivity (32 commits/month average)**, senior employees exhibit **alarming disengagement**: their productivity inversely correlates with tenure (r=-0.34), averaging only 10 commits/month—less than juniors. This pattern intensifies over time, with zero-commit rates doubling from 7% in year one to 14% after three years, disproportionately affecting long-tenured staff. The data suggests senior employees either transition into non-coding roles without title changes, experience burnout, or lack meaningful technical challenges. **Immediate interventions needed**: audit senior role expectations, create technical leadership tracks that maintain hands-on work, implement retention programs targeting 3+ year employees, and investigate why your most experienced talent is disengaging from core technical contributions.
