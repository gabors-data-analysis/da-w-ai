The pattern is a clear **ramp-up with tenure, peaking mid-tenure, then softening**: new hires (<6 m) have median 5 commits/month, rising through 6–12 m: 7 and 1–2 y: 10.5, peaking at 2–4 y: 20, then easing at 4–10 y: 12 and 10 y+: 1 (n=26). Overall distribution is skewed (P50=10, P90=38, P99≈98), so a **few very high contributors drive mean spikes, but the robust (median) pattern holds**. Management: invest in faster onboarding for the first year, double-down on enabling and retaining 2–4-year staff (they are the core producers), and re-energize longer-tenure employees (rotation, new roles, or training) where output often tapers.
