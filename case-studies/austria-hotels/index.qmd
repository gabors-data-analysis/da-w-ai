- **Many-to-Many:** Hotels to Amenities (through `hotel_amenities`)
- **Composite Keys:** Monthly data uses `(hotel_id, month, year)`

## Learning Objectives

- Inner, left, right, and full joins
- One-to-one and one-to-many relationships
- Composite key joins
- Data aggregation after joins
- Handling missing values in joins
