## The course design


# Prompt for Claude 4.0 
(2025-06-01)


::: {.week-card .card}
::: {.card-header}
üîß **Is name week00 OK?**
  :::
  ::: {.card-body}

**G√°bor**:  
"I plan to add a new weekly material, let us call it week00 for now. It's a prep course related to coding for data analysis. Ie not all kinds of stuff just data warnglin, analysis, ML, causal inference, etc. some data science too. 

Can you help design it? Here are some ideas. It should 
* introduce the idea of how AI can help coding especially in Python, and R. 
* why it works
* how to best prompt to get a good answer, which models to use in claude and chatgpt. or what's difference between models. 
* give examples of use cases, 4 examples, 2-4 lines each. 
*  showcase available extra tools like data analysis, and canvas in chatgpt, your projects
* talk about other code specific tools like cursor
* talk about github copilot
* discuss how to github copilot in (a) vscode, (b) jupyter notebook, (c) Rstudio. explain how to use it in a workflow. 

The first version should be sketchy, and brief. We'll expand gradually."

Then the current version is pretty close.

## Nameing



::: {.week-card .card}
::: {.card-header}
üîß **Is name week00 OK?**
  :::
  ::: {.card-body}

**G√°bor**: 
  
"I'm struggling with this decision. Shall I add it as week00 or rename all weeks (01-->02 etc) and have this as 01. what do you think?"**


**Claude:**

I'd recommend **keeping it as Week 00** for several practical and pedagogical reasons:

## ‚úÖ **Arguments for Week 00:**

**Practical Benefits:**
- **No disruption:** Keeps all existing numbering, assignments, internal links intact
- **Less work:** Avoids the error-prone task of updating references throughout
- **Flexibility:** Students with strong AI coding experience could potentially skip/skim

**Pedagogical Logic:**
- **Common convention:** Week 00 is standard in CS courses for "setup" content
- **Clear signaling:** "This is foundational preparation, not optional"
- **Entry point flexibility:** Students can assess their own readiness

## üéØ **Make Week 00 Feel Essential:**

**In course description/syllabus:**
- "Week 00 (REQUIRED): AI-Assisted Coding Fundamentals"
- "Essential preparation for all subsequent weeks"

**In Week 01 intro:**
- "This course assumes familiarity with AI coding tools covered in Week 00"
- Brief recap/check that students completed the prep

**Cross-references:**
- Link back to Week 00 techniques throughout other weeks
- "As we covered in Week 00's prompting strategies..."

## ‚öñÔ∏è **Alternative Consideration:**

The **only** reason I'd consider renumbering is if you find that students consistently skip Week 00 and then struggle. But you can address this with:
- Clear communication about importance
- Quick competency check in Week 01
- Making Week 00 content prerequisite for assignments

**Recommendation:** Start with Week 00, see how it works in practice, and renumber later if needed. Much easier to go from 00‚Üí01 than to undo a full renumbering.

What's your gut feeling on student behavior - would they skip something labeled "Week 00"?
