# my single prompt

```
This is my data and the codebook. Create a variable dictionary. Use the pdf i shared earlier. Output as markdown. For each variable: varname, labels, type, coverage (% missing), mean and mode. Round up numbers. Look at cps and provide short labels. Get me an .md I can download.

## Data Quality Notes

**Missing Data**: Unable to calculate precise coverage statistics without data access. Refer to original CPS documentation for universe definitions.

**Weights**: Use `weight` variable for population estimates. The earnings weight `earnwt` is preferred for earnings-related analyses.

**Time Period**: This extract contains data from 2014 MORG files (outgoing rotation groups only).

**Top Coding**: Earnings variables may be top-coded. Check for density spikes at maximum values.

## Key Variable Relationships

- **Labor Force Status** (`lfsr94`): Controls universe for many employment variables
- **Education** (`grade92`): Uses post-1992 credential-based classification
- **Earnings** (`earnwke`): Available only for wage/salary workers; excludes self-employed
- **Hours** (`uhours`): Usual hours at main job
- **Demographics**: Standard CPS demographic variables with consistent coding

---

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Weights**: Always use appropriate weights for population estimates
2. **Missing Values**: Check universe definitions in codebook
3. **Time Series**: Be aware of classification changes across years
4. **Earnings**: Exclude self-employed workers for wage analyses
5. **Industry/Occupation**: Codes based on 2002 NAICS and 2010 SOC systems
