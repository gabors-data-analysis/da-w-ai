# Prompt for Claude 4.0 
(2025-06-01)

"I plan to add a new weekly material, let us call it week00 for now. It's a prep course related to coding for data analysis. Ie not all kinds of stuff just data warnglin, analysis, ML, causal inference, etc. some data science too. 

Can you help design it? Here are some ideas. It should 
* introduce the idea of how AI can help coding especially in Python, and R. 
* why it works
* how to best prompt to get a good answer, which models to use in claude and chatgpt. or what's difference between models. 
* give examples of use cases, 4 examples, 2-4 lines each. 
*  showcase available extra tools like data analysis, and canvas in chatgpt, your projects
* talk about other code specific tools like cursor
* talk about github copilot
* discuss how to github copilot in (a) vscode, (b) jupyter notebook, (c) Rstudio. explain how to use it in a workflow. 

The first version should be sketchy, and brief. We'll expand gradually."
