## What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is a command-line tool made by Anthropic that lets you work with Claude AI directly in your terminal (the text-based interface on your computer). Instead of chatting in a browser, you type commands and Claude helps you with coding, file editing, data analysis, and more — right where your code lives.

**Why use it?**

- Works directly with your files and folders
- Can read, edit, and create code for you
- Runs commands and sees the output
- Great for data analysis workflows
- No copy-pasting between browser and code editor

## Windows {#windows}

### Step 1: Install Node.js

Claude Code needs Node.js (a program that runs JavaScript) to work.

1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download the **LTS** version (the button on the left)
3. Run the installer
4. Click **Next** through all the steps (default settings are fine)
5. Check the box for "Automatically install necessary tools" if asked
6. Click **Install**, then **Finish**

### Step 2: Open Terminal

1. Press the **Windows key** on your keyboard
2. Type `cmd`
3. Click on **Command Prompt**

A black window with white text will open. This is your terminal.

### Step 3: Install Claude Code

In the terminal window, type this exactly and press **Enter**:

```
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Wait for it to finish (may take 1-2 minutes). You'll see some text scrolling.

### Step 4: Start Claude Code

In the same terminal, type:

```
claude
```

The first time, it will ask you to log in with your Anthropic account (the same one you use for claude.ai). Follow the instructions on screen.

### You're done!

Type your questions or requests and press Enter. Type `exit` to quit.

## Quick Tips

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `claude` | Start Claude Code |
| `exit` | Quit Claude Code |
| `claude --help` | See all options |
| `/help` | Get help while inside Claude |

## Requirements

- **Anthropic account** — Sign up at [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) if you don't have one
- **Claude Pro or API access** — Claude Code requires a paid subscription or API credits
- **Internet connection** — Claude runs in the cloud

## Troubleshooting

**"npm not found"** — Node.js didn't install correctly. Restart your terminal and try again, or reinstall Node.js.

**"Permission denied"** — On Mac/Linux, add `sudo` before the command. On Windows, right-click Command Prompt and select "Run as administrator".

**"Authentication failed"** — Make sure you're using the same account you use for claude.ai and that you have an active subscription.
