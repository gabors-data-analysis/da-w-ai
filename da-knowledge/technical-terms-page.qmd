# Core Concepts

::: {.term-section}
## Token

The basic unit of text that LLMs process. 

- Roughly 4 characters or ¾ of a word in English
- "Hello world" ≈ 2 tokens
- Pricing and limits are measured in tokens
:::

::: {.term-section}
## Context Window

The maximum amount of text (in tokens) an LLM can consider at once.

- Includes: system prompt + your messages + AI responses + uploads
- GPT-5.2: ~400k tokens; Gemini 3: ~1M tokens
- Exceeding the limit causes the model to "forget" earlier content
:::

::: {.term-section}
## Inference

The process of generating output from a trained model.

- Input goes in → model processes → output comes out
- Distinct from *training* (which creates the model)
- What happens every time you send a message
:::

::: {.term-section}
## Latency

The time delay between sending a request and receiving a response.

- Measured in milliseconds or seconds
- Affected by: model size, input length, server load
- Trade-off: faster models are often less capable
:::

# Model Architecture

::: {.term-section}
## LLM (Large Language Model)

A neural network trained on massive text data to predict and generate language.

- "Large" = billions of parameters
- Learns patterns from training data
- Examples: GPT-5, Claude 4.5, Gemini 3
:::

::: {.term-section}
## Transformer

The neural network architecture underlying modern LLMs.

- Introduced in 2017 ("Attention Is All You Need")
- Key innovation: self-attention mechanism
- Enables parallel processing of sequences
:::

::: {.term-section}
## Parameters

The learned values (weights) inside a neural network.

- More parameters ≈ more capacity to learn patterns
- GPT-4: ~1 trillion parameters (estimated)
- Trade-off: larger models are slower and more expensive
:::

::: {.term-section}
## Mixture of Experts (MoE)

An architecture that activates only a subset of parameters for each query.

- Used by Gemini 3 (over 1 trillion total parameters)
- Only relevant "experts" are activated per query
- Balances deep intelligence with faster response times
:::

# Prompting & Context

::: {.term-section}
## System Prompt

Hidden instructions given to the AI before your conversation.

- Defines persona, constraints, behavior
- Set by platform or user (Custom Instructions, Projects)
- The AI "sees" this before your first message
:::

::: {.term-section}
## Context Engineering

The practice of curating all information the model receives to optimize performance.

- Goes beyond prompt engineering
- Includes: system prompt, memory, tools, retrieved documents
- Key skill for building reliable AI applications

[Learn more: Anthropic's context engineering guide](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents)
:::

::: {.term-section}
## RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

A technique that retrieves relevant documents and adds them to the prompt.

- Helps ground responses in specific data
- Reduces hallucinations
- Powers many enterprise AI applications
:::

# Reasoning & Thinking

::: {.term-section}
## Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

A prompting technique where the model shows intermediate reasoning steps.

- "Let's think step by step"
- Improves accuracy on complex tasks
- Can be prompted or built into the model
:::

::: {.term-section}
## Reasoning Model

A model specifically trained to "think" before responding.

- Examples: OpenAI o3, o4-mini; Claude with extended thinking
- Internal deliberation, then final answer
- Better for math, logic, multi-step problems
:::

::: {.term-section}
## Extended Thinking

A mode where the model explicitly reasons through problems.

- Visible chain of thought (unlike o3)
- Configurable thinking "budget"
- Trade-off: higher latency and cost
:::

::: {.term-section}
## Thinking Levels

Gemini 3's approach to controlling reasoning depth.

- **LOW**: Fast, minimal deliberation
- **MEDIUM**: Balanced (default)
- **HIGH**: Deep reasoning, higher latency — uses parallel thinking and "self-correction" signatures to solve complex logic or math problems
:::

# Tools & Agents

::: {.term-section}
## Agent

An AI system that can take actions, not just generate text.

- Uses tools (code execution, web search, file access)
- Operates semi-autonomously
- May involve multiple steps and decisions
:::

::: {.term-section}
## Agentic Workflow

A process where AI acts across multiple steps with tool use.

- Example: Search → Analyze → Write → Review
- Less human intervention between steps
- Requires careful design and guardrails
:::

::: {.term-section}
## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

An open standard for connecting AI to external tools and data.

- "USB-C for AI applications"
- Developed by Anthropic, adopted broadly
- Enables secure access to files, databases, APIs

[Learn more: MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)
:::

::: {.term-section}
## Tool Use / Function Calling

The ability of an AI to invoke external functions or APIs.

- Model outputs structured "tool call"
- System executes the tool
- Result fed back to model
:::

# Quality & Safety

::: {.term-section}
## Hallucination

When an AI generates plausible-sounding but false information.

- Fabricated facts, fake references, incorrect code
- Reduced but not eliminated in modern models
- Mitigated by grounding, RAG, verification
:::

::: {.term-section}
## Grounding

Connecting AI responses to verified sources of truth.

- Web search, document retrieval, database queries
- Reduces hallucinations
- Enables citations
:::

::: {.term-section}
## RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)

A training technique where models learn from human preferences.

- Humans rate model outputs
- Model learns to produce preferred responses
- Key to making models "helpful and harmless"
:::

::: {.term-section}
## Constitutional AI

Anthropic's approach to training models with explicit principles.

- Model trained to follow a "constitution" of rules
- Self-improvement through AI feedback
- Alternative to pure RLHF
:::

# Platform Features

::: {.term-section}
## Skills (Claude)

Reusable, modular instruction packages in Claude.

- Pre-defined workflows and behaviors
- Shareable across conversations
- Can be combined for complex tasks
:::

::: {.term-section}
## Gems (Gemini)

Custom AI assistants in Gemini Advanced.

- User-defined personas and instructions
- Persistent across conversations
- Shareable with team
:::

::: {.term-section}
## Projects (Claude)

Workspaces with shared context across conversations.

- Persistent system prompt
- Uploaded knowledge files
- All chats share the same context
:::

::: {.term-section}
## Canvas / Artifacts

Interactive workspaces for editing AI-generated content.

- ChatGPT Canvas, Claude Artifacts
- Side-by-side editing
- Good for code and documents
:::

# Performance & Efficiency

::: {.term-section}
## Temperature

A parameter controlling randomness in model outputs.

- 0 = deterministic (same input → same output)
- 1 = default, balanced creativity
- Higher = more random/creative

**Note:** Gemini 3 and reasoning models work best at default (1.0)
:::

::: {.term-section}
## Context Rot

Performance degradation as the context window fills up.

- Model becomes less accurate over long conversations
- Even within technical limits
- Solution: start fresh, use memory tools
:::

::: {.term-section}
## KV-Cache

A technical optimization that speeds up repeated inference.

- Caches intermediate computations
- Faster response for repeated prefixes
- Why stable prompt prefixes matter for cost
:::

# Development Patterns

::: {.term-section}
## Vibe Coding

Describing desired behavior in natural language rather than writing syntax.

- "Make this chart interactive with company colors"
- AI translates intent to code
- Requires human review and iteration
:::

::: {.term-section}
## CLAUDE.md

A convention for providing project context to Claude Code.

- Markdown file in project root
- Contains: file descriptions, conventions, current task
- Automatically read by Claude Code CLI
:::

::: {.term-section}
## Prompt Chaining

Breaking complex tasks into sequential prompts.

- Output of step N becomes input to step N+1
- More reliable than single complex prompt
- Enables debugging at each stage
:::

# Costs & Limits

::: {.term-section}
## Input/Output Tokens

Tokens are billed separately for input (prompt) and output (response).

- Input: what you send (including context)
- Output: what the model generates
- Output tokens typically cost more
:::

::: {.term-section}
## Rate Limiting

Restrictions on how many requests you can make.

- Requests per minute (RPM)
- Tokens per minute (TPM)
- Prevents abuse and ensures fair access
:::

::: {.term-section}
## Prompt Caching

Storing and reusing processed prompts to reduce cost.

- Same prefix → cached, cheaper
- Useful for repeated system prompts
- Requires stable prompt structure
:::
