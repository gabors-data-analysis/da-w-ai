## What is a Terminal?

A **terminal** (also called command line, shell, or console) is a text-based interface to your computer. Instead of clicking icons, you type commands.

Why does this matter for Claude Code? Claude Code runs in the terminal. It reads your files, runs code, and shows results - all through text commands.

**Don't worry:** You don't need to become a terminal expert. Just learn the basics below.

## Common Issues

### "Command not found" for `claude`

Claude Code isn't installed, or not in your PATH.

**Fix:** Follow the [Claude Code install guide](install-cli.html#claude-code)

### "No such file or directory"

You typed a path that doesn't exist.

**Fix:**
1. Use `ls` (or `dir`) to see what's actually in your folder
2. Check spelling
3. Use Tab completion

### "Permission denied"

You don't have access to that folder/file.

**Fix:**
- On Mac/Linux: Try adding `sudo` before the command (you'll need your password)
- On Windows: Run terminal as Administrator (right-click → Run as administrator)
