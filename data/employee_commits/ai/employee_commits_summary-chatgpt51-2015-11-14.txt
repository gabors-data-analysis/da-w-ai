The chart shows an inverted-U: monthly commits rise steadily during the first ~3–5 years, peak around 4–5 years of tenure (roughly 1.5–2× the average commit rate), and then decline for long-tenure staff. In other words, your most productive coders are mid-tenure employees; both very new hires and very long-tenured staff commit substantially less, suggesting onboarding support for juniors and re-energizing or role-adjusting for long-tenure employees could raise overall output
