Our analysis of employee data reveals a moderate positive correlation between an employee's tenure (days with the company) and their monthly code commits. As illustrated in the accompanying chart, while there is significant variation among individuals, the general trend shows that employees with a longer tenure tend to have a slightly higher number of monthly commits. This pattern suggests that, on average, employees remain engaged in hands-on development and technical contribution as they gain more experience at the company, rather than universally shifting away from coding tasks.
