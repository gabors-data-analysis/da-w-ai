Management Summary:
The analysis reveals a striking pattern: employee commit activity is determined almost entirely by job role, not tenure. With a near-zero correlation (0.019) between days with the company and monthly commits, tenure is essentially irrelevant to coding productivity. Instead, role drives everything—Data Engineers and Developers average 27 and 24 commits per month respectively, while Analysts and Infrastructure staff average just 6 and 4 commits. This 6x difference reflects fundamental job function variations rather than performance issues. Notably, 9% of employees have zero commits, distributed proportionally across roles, suggesting these positions involve non-coding responsibilities. The implication for management: productivity metrics should be role-specific rather than company-wide, and hiring/retention strategies should focus on role fit rather than assuming tenure correlates with output.
